HTML s-expression parsing

we want to traverse s-exps that look like so:

(((:P :class "foo") "this is lame!")
 (:H1 "Abstract")
 (:P "CLEM is an open-source Common Lisp library for the
 representation and manipulation of matrices. CLEM is designed to
 be a flexible and extensible system for the representation of
 arbitrary 2-dimensional matrices.")
 (:H1 "Introduction")
 (:P "The Common Lisp language"
     (:BIBCITE "steele1990common")
     " offers a rich, dynamic environment for programming and
data analysis. Common Lisp contains a powerful object system, the
Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)"
     (:BIBCITE "keene89object")
     ", and most modern implementations support a protocol for
the generation not just of new classes and objects, but to extend
the object system itself using the Meta-object Protocol"
     (:BIBCITE "kiczales91art")
     ".")
...)

The car of the list is special. It is either a tag or a string:

1. "this is bogus"

2. A. (:p "this is bogus")

   B. (:p "This is " ((:a :href "http://lame.com" :class "moo") "lame") (:bibcite "harmon"))

3. ((:a :href "http://lame.com") "This is bogus")

Are the things we want to support
