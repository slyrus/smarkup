  abstract = {The sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster genome presented in this
	issue of Science is the latest milestone in nine decades of research
	on this organism. Genetic and physical mapping, whole-genome mutational
	screens, and functional alteration of the genome by gene transfer
	were pioneered in metazoans with the use of this small fruit fly.
	Here we look at some of the instances in which work on Drosophila
	has led to major conceptual or technical breakthroughs in our understanding
	of animal genomes.},
